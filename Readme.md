# LoopTNR

AD-based implementation of the [loop-TNR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04938) algorithm with the [nuclear-norm regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17479).

It supports

* symmetric tensor manipulations powered by [YASTN](https://github.com/yastn/yastn)

* generic multi-site unit cell
